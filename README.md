I'll just take 2-3 minutes to thank everyone here or may be few more minutes as I'll go one by one. 

I joined this team as a fresher and I’d heard all kinds of client stories from others, but this team was completely different. Here, everyone, including Sarav, Eric, Tedd & everyone, was so open to ideas & discussions. Like there was never that strict “do it this way” approach here, & it really gave me the freedom to explore, & learn. Also, the kind of exposure I got here in less than 2 years, I feel like it usually takes years to get. So thank u so much Eric, Sarav & Tedd for letting me to play at my strike rate.

I want to thank Lisa also, she has been my go-to lead for almost everything either it is business related or technical stuffs bcoz I’m someone who doesn’t really follow blindly, you can say I'm not a good follower in that sense; but I try to understand the reasons first. And, that’s what I got in discussions with her, she always explained the “why”, not just the “what” and even she used to share online articles to help me understand things more deeply.

And same goes with Jason also, he has helped me a lot whether it is related to code changes, deployments, environments, Git, github, bitbucket, etc. He always explained things with what's happening behind & how we'll be or how we should be tackling it. 

so thank you so much Lisa & Jason.

I'll also thank Bikash who really guided me a lot, specially with those SPOS during that export functionality, like his inputs really helped me in tackling the issues I faced while working on that.

so Thank you Bikash

Also, I don't want to miss Greg, as he is not with our team right now, but he had also helped me a lot with DB related stuffs, so thanks to him as well.

And from offshore, a big thanks to Suhas & Akshay — I can’t list everything in single call, but they’ve truly been my support system here.

I think I already took so much time so I'll just close here, it’s been a great experience working with such a supportive and collaborative team. thank you, thank you so much each and everyone from onsite and from offshore as well, for all those learnings I got bcoz of you, I’ll definitely carry all those good or bad lessons forward with me. 

Thank you so much!
